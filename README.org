A Rust GitOps/symlinkfarm orchestrator inspired by GNU Stow. Useful for dealing
with "dotfiles", and with git support as a first class feature. Configuration is
done throug a single yaml file, giving it a paradigm that should bring joy to
those that use declarative operating systems and package managers.

Although this isn't really a case where it matters *that* much for performance,
being written in rust instead of e.g. /janky/ scripting languages does also mean
it is snappy and reliable, and the /extensive/ (hardly, but eventually) testing
helps ensure regressions aren't introduced.

That said, we're in 0.Y.Z, *here be dragons* for now (although a little less each
commit).

** Installation
#+begin_src sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cafkafk/seidr
$ cd seidr
$ cargo install --path .
#+end_src

** Configuration
If you want a template, you can copy the file from src/test/config.yaml:
#+begin_src sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/seidr/
$ cp src/test/config.yaml ~/.config/seidr/config.yaml
#+end_src

You should *seriously* change this file before running any commands.

The configuration format will likely break regularly in versions 0.Y.Z.
